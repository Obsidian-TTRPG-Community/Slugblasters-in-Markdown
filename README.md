# Slugblast in Markdown
The awesome TTRPG game Slugblasters, now available in Markdown format.

Just a big note: This is NOT a substitute for the original book! There are many nuances, diagrams, and footnotes that aren't represented here. The main purpose of this repo is to provide an easy way to access the things that might be relevant at a table. Anything you would need to open the book for for a closer look, open the book!

## About the repo

This repo contains the random tables, groups, named npcs, and other giblets that are contained within the main [Slugblasters PDF](https://wilkies.itch.io/slugblaster). Along with the base markdown included are some enhanced features provided by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). These features are provided by plugins, denoted here:

- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) (Dynamic lists from files, great for listing groups, worlds, and npcs)
- [Obsidian Leaflet](https://github.com/javalent/obsidian-leaflet) (Interactive maps, great for clicking on through the multiverse)
- [Dice Roller](https://github.com/javalent/dice-roller) (Makes random tables rollable)

To make use of these features, open the `🐌 Slugblasters` folder within this repo as a Vault within Obsidian. All of these features are displayed in use in the `🐌 Dashboard` file.

**Note 1**: [Wikilinks](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) (and other Obsidian specific syntax) are extremely prevalent within the files. Most (if not all) programs don't know what any of these are, so use at your own risk.

**Note 2**: Some assets might be missing. The reason is because they are not explicitly present in the main book.

### Style

Style is the main focus in Slugblasters, so there is a `Obsidian-Accujson.json`, a style json meant for use with the [AnuPpuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/anuppuccin) theme. You can change themes in the `Options > Appearance > Themes` dropdown (pre-bundled for convienience), and import the style settings through the `Options > Style Settings` menu.

This is completely optional, but recommended if you don't want to fiddle around with themes in Obsidian.
